# Webminipoject
7th semester Web mini project by using simple html,css,php and javascript.

# How to run
1. Download a xampp server for hosting on system's local server
2. Configure the xampp server and check whether the server is running or not on the browser.
3. Sometimes in ubuntu, there would be already a server running, so before you start the apache server, you need to stop this server by using the command  "sudo service apache2 stop" and then start the xampp server "sudo /opt/lampp/lampp start".
4. In windows, the database port would be occupied, so there the port number has to be changed to run the server correctly.

# In Ubuntu
1. The files should be stored in
  Open the File manager
  Go to computer
  Open opt file
  Open lampp file
  Open htdocs file
 Here you have to save the code.
